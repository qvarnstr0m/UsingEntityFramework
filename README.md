#### Short summary of requirements:  
The project involves adding example data to a database and creating a C# console program. The program will have a simple navigation allowing the user to choose from various functions.  

Using Entity Framework, the user can retrieve all students and sort by first or last name and in ascending or descending order. They can also retrieve all students in a specific class.  

Using SQL, the user can retrieve all personnel or just a specific category, retrieve grades set in the past month, retrieve a list of all courses and average grades, and add new students.  

Extra challenges include validating personal IDs with SQL, creating a view to retrieve grades set in the past month, and building a function to retrieve average grades based on gender and age group/year.
